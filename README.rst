Browser testing with splinter
-----------------------------

`Splinter`_ is a library which provides a common browser API with a driver
for `zope.testbrowser`.

The `ftw.testing` package provides integration of `Splinter`_ with Plone
using Page Objects.

For using the splinter features, use the `splinter` extras require::

    ftw.testing [splinter]


Setting a package up for browser tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's easy to setup your package for browser tests:

- Add a test-dependency to `ftw.testing` in your `setup.py`:

.. code:: python

    tests_require = [
        'ftw.testing[splinter]',
        ]

    setup(name='my.package',
          ...
          tests_require=tests_require,
          extras_require=dict(tests=tests_require),
          )

- In your `testing.py` use the `FunctionalSplinterTesting` layer wrapper:

.. code:: python

    from ftw.testing import FunctionalSplinterTesting
    from plone.app.testing import PLONE_FIXTURE
    from plone.app.testing import PloneSandboxLayer
    from plone.app.testing import applyProfile
    from zope.configuration import xmlconfig


    class MyPackageLayer(PloneSandboxLayer):

        defaultBases = (PLONE_FIXTURE,)

        def setUpZope(self, app, configurationContext):
            import my.package
            xmlconfig.file('configure.zcml', my.package)

        def setUpPloneSite(self, portal):
            applyProfile(portal, 'my.package:default')


    MY_PACKAGE_FIXTURE = MyPackageLayer()
    MY_PACKAGE_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING = FunctionalSplinterTesting(
        bases=(MY_PACKAGE_FIXTURE, ),
        name="my.package:functional")

- Write tests using the Plone Page Objects:

.. code:: python

    from ftw.testing import browser
    from ftw.testing.pages import Plone
    from my.package.testing import MY_PACKAGE_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING
    from plone.app.testing import SITE_OWNER_NAME
    from plone.app.testing import SITE_OWNER_PASSWORD
    from unittest2 import TestCase


    class TestDocument(TestCase):

        layer = MY_PACKAGE_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING

        def test_add_document(self):
            Plone().login(SITE_OWNER_NAME, SITE_OWNER_PASSWORD)
            Plone().visit_portal()
            Plone().create_object('Page', {'Title': 'Foo',
                                           'Body Text': '<b>Hello World</b>'})
            self.assertTrue(browser().is_text_present('Hello World'))


Writing Page Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write your own Page Objects for your views and content types.
Put a module `pages.py` in your tests folder:

.. code:: python

    from ftw.testing.pages import Plone


    class MyContentType(Plone):

        def create_my_content(self, title, text):
            self.create_object('MyContent', {'Title': title,
                                             'Body Text': text})
            return self

The Page Object should have methods for all features of your view.



Using the Plone Page Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Plone page object provided by `ftw.testing` already has the most
important features built in, such as:

- portal_url handling
- Login
- Accessing Headings, <body>-CSS-classes, status messages
- Adding content
- TinyMCE handling

Currently it's best to just look in the
`page object code <https://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.testing/blob/master/ftw/testing/pages.py>`_.



MockTestCase
------------

``ftw.testing`` provides an advanced MockTestCase which provides bases on
the `plone.mocktestcase`_ ``MockTestCase``.

.. code:: python

    from ftw.testing import MockTestCase


The following additional methods are available:

``self.providing_mock(interfaces, *args, **kwargs)``
      Creates a mock which provides ``interfaces``.

``self.mock_interface(interface, provides=None, *args, **kwargs)``
      Creates a mock object implementing ``interface``. The mock does not
      only provide ``interface``, but also use it as specification and
      asserts that the mocked methods do exist on the interface.

``self.stub(*args, **kwargs)``
      Creates a stub. It acts like a mock but has no assertions.

``self.providing_stub(interfaces, *args, **kwargs)``
      Creates a stub which provides ``interfaces``.

``self.stub_interface(interface, provides=None, *args, **kwargs)``
      Does the same as ``mock_interface``, but disables counting of expected
      method calls and attribute access. See "Mocking vs. stubbing" below.

``self.set_parent(context, parent_context)``
      Stubs the ``context`` so that its acquisition parent is ``parent_context``.
      Expects at least context to be a mock or a stub. Returns the ``context``.

``self.stub_request(interfaces=[], stub_response=True, content_type='text/html', status=200)``
      Returns a request stub which can be used for rendering templates. With the
      ``stub_response`` option, you can define if the request should stub a
      response by itself. The other optional arguments:
      ``content_type``: Defines the expected output content type of the response.
      ``status``: Defines the expected status code of the response.

``self.stub_response(request=None, content_type='text/html', status=200))``
      Returns a stub response with some headers and options. When a ``request``
      is given the response is also added to the given request.
      The other optional arguments:
      ``content_type``: Defines the expected output content type of the response.
      ``status``: Defines the expected status code of the response.

``self.assertRaises(*args, **kwargs)``
      Uses ``unittest2`` implementation of assertRaises instead of
      ``unittest`` implementation.

It also fixes a problem in ``mock_tool``, where the ``getToolByName`` mock
had assertions which is not very useful in some cases.


Mocking vs. stubbing
--------------------

A **mock** is used for testing the communication between two objects. It
asserts *method calls*. This is used when a test should not test if
a object has a specific state after doing something (e.g. it has it's
attribute *xy* set to something), but if the object *does* something
with another object. If for example an object `Foo` sends an email
when method `bar` is called, we could mock the sendmail object and
assert on the send-email method call.

On the other hand we often have to test the state of an object (attribute
values) after doing something. This can be done without mocks by just
calling the method and asserting the attribute values. But then we have
to set up an integration test and install plone, which takes very long.
For testing an object with dependencies to other parts of plone in a
unit test, we can use **stubs** for faking other (separately tested) parts
of plone. Stubs work like mocks: you can "expect" a method call and
define a result. The difference between **stubs** and **mocks** is that
stubs do not assert the expectations, so there will be no errors if
something expected does not happen. So when using stubs we can assert
the state without asserting the communcation between objects.


Component registry layer
------------------------

The ``MockTestCase`` is able to mock components (adapters, utilities). It
cleans up the component registry after every test.

But when we use a ZCML layer, loading the ZCML of the package it should use
the same component registry for all tests on the same layer. The
``ComponentRegistryLayer`` is a layer superclass for sharing the component
registry and speeding up tests.

Usage:

.. code:: python

    from ftw.testing.layer import ComponentRegistryLayer

    class ZCMLLayer(ComponentRegistryLayer):

        def setUp(self):
            super(ZCMLLayer, self).setUp()

            import my.package
            self.load_zcml_file('configure.zcml', my.package)

    ZCML_LAYER = ZCMLLayer()

Be aware that ``ComponentRegistryLayer`` is a base class for creating your
own layer (by subclassing ``ComponentRegistryLayer``) and is not usable with
``defaultBases`` directly. This allows us to use the functions
``load_zcml_file`` and ``load_zcml_string``.


Mailing test helper
-------------------
The Mailing helper object mocks the mailhost and captures sent emails.
The emails can then be easily used for assertions.

Usage:

.. code:: python

    from ftw.testing.mailing import Mailing
    import transaction

    class MyTest(TestCase):
        layer = MY_FUNCTIONAL_TESTING

     def setUp(self):
         Mailing(self.layer['portal']).set_up()
         transaction.commit()

     def tearDown(self):
         Mailing(self.layer['portal']).tear_down()

     def test_mail_stuff(self):
         portal = self.layer['portal']
         do_send_email()
         mail = Mailing(portal).pop()
         self.assertEquals('Subject: ...', mail)


Freezing datetime.now()
-----------------------

When testing code which depends on the current time, it is necessary to set
the current time to a specific time. The ``freeze`` context manager makes that
really easy:

.. code:: python

    from ftw.testing import freeze
    from datetime import datetime

    with freeze(datetime(2014, 5, 7, 12, 30)):
        # test code

The ``freeze`` context manager patches the `datetime` module, the `time` module
and supports the Zope `DateTime` module. It removes the patches when exiting
the context manager.


Generic Setup uninstall test
----------------------------

``ftw.testing`` provides a test superclass for testing uninstall profiles.
The test makes a Generic Setup snapshot before installing the package, then
installs and uninstalls the package, creates another snapshot and diffs it.
The package is installed without installing its dependencies, because it
should not include uninstalling dependencies in the uninstall profile.

Appropriate testing layer setup is included and the test runs on a seperate
layer which should not interfere with other tests.

Simple example:

.. code:: python

    from ftw.testing.genericsetup import GenericSetupUninstallMixin
    from ftw.testing.genericsetup import apply_generic_setup_layer
    from unittest2 import TestCase


    @apply_generic_setup_layer
    class TestGenericSetupUninstall(TestCase, GenericSetupUninstallMixin):
        package = 'my.package'


The ``my.package`` is expected to have a Generic Setup profile
``profile-my.package:default`` for installing the package and a
``profile-my.package:uninstall`` for uninstalling the package.
It is expected to use ``z3c.autoinclude`` entry points for loading
its ZCML.

The options are configured as class variables:

**package**
    The dotted name of the package as string, which is used for things such
    as guessing the Generic Setup profile names. This is mandatory.

**is_product** (``False``)
    Set this to True when you have a product, which is when you have
    an ``initialize`` function in your package. This is always the case if you
    define new Archetypes contents.
    The product name is expected to be the same as ``package``.

**autoinclude** (``True``)
    This makes the testing fixture load ZCML using the ``z3c.autoinclude``
    entry points registered for the target ``plone``.

**additional_zcml_packages** (``()``)
    Use this if needed ZCML is not loaded using the ``autoinclude`` option,
    e.g. when you need to load testing zcml. Pass in an iterable of
    dottednames of packages, which contain a ``configure.zcml``.

**additional_products** (``()``)
    A list of additional Zope products to install.

**install_profile_name** (``default``)
    The Generic Setup install profile name postfix.

**uninstall_profile_name** (``uninstall``)
    The Generic Setup uninstall profile name postfix.

**skip_files** (``()``)
    An iterable of Generic Setup files (e.g. ``("viewlets.xml",)``) to be
    ignored in the diff. This is sometimes necessary, because not all
    components can and should be uninstalled properly. For example viewlet
    orders cannot be removed using Generic Setup - but this is not a problem
    they do no longer take effect when the viewlets / viewlet managers are
    no longer registered.


Full example:

.. code:: python

    from ftw.testing.genericsetup import GenericSetupUninstallMixin
    from ftw.testing.genericsetup import apply_generic_setup_layer
    from unittest2 import TestCase


    @apply_generic_setup_layer
    class TestGenericSetupUninstall(TestCase, GenericSetupUninstallMixin):
        package = 'my.package'
        is_package = True
        autoinclude = False
        additional_zcml_packages = ('my.package', 'my.package.tests')
        additional_products = ('another.package', )
        install_profile_name = 'default'
        uninstall_profile_name = 'uninstall'
        skip_files = ('viewlets.xml', 'rolemap.xml')
